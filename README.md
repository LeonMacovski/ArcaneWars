To use a spell, you have to hold the Shift key and draw on the screen. The available spells and their associated drawings are shown in the spells.png file. 
At first, it might seem difficult to draw the spell but after a few attempts it becomes simpler. Some of the lines have numbers meaning they have to 
be drawn in that oreder(ascending). A spell can be either instantly cast upon drawing, or it may be a selected spell in which case the player will have
to click the left mouse button to cast the spell. The selected spell will appear on the bottom right corner of the screen.
